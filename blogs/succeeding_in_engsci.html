        <ol class="spaced-list">
          <li>
            <b>Make the process of information ingestion more efficient</b>: for
            me this meant skipping most lectures in favor of reading the text
            book and/or lecture notes. The exception is when there are no notes
            / textbook / recordings. Don't focus on taking notes, instead focus
            on (2).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Spaced repetition</b>: With the time I saved from (1), I would
            focus on putting the knowledge into a spaced-repetition software
            like Anki. See Augmenting Long-Term Memory for how to do this.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Lots of practice</b>: do as many practice problems as possible.
            These can come from past exams (look on Skule and Github; these are
            probably the most applicable to how you will be graded), textbook
            problems, and exercises that the prof posts. If your really staving
            for practice problems then you can look up similar courses online,
            or get a small group of peers and quiz on another. When reviewing
            lecture material, if there are any obvious exam questions the Prof
            would ask then do those too.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Sleep and exercise</b>: get on a consistent sleep schedule and do
            not break it for any reason! I would also exercise daily if
            possible. For me afternoon is the best because it is when I am least
            productive. I have a nice block of focused work in the morning and
            evening.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Avoid "wasted work"</b>: There are lots of examples of this:
          </li>
          <li>
            "study groups" can seem productive, but lots of the time ends up
            being spent on socialization
          </li>
          <li>
            Over-planning / organizing / productivity optimizing is a great way
            to seem busy but not actually get anything done.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Think long term</b>: Copying solutions from others or forgetting
            all your learnings after the final exam is a great way to set
            yourself up for failure in future courses. Don't stop the spaced
            repetition after the course is over, unless it is something you
            really don't think will be useful in the future (e.g,. most HSS/CS
            electives).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b
              >Get a group of smart and interesting friends taking the
              same/similar courses</b
            >: This group can help answer questions you have. On the other hand,
            answering their questions / teaching is a great way to solidify your
            understanding.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Summer Internships</b>: Relationships with Profs are important
            both for your final thesis project, getting work experience, and
            future jobs. I would encourage you to seek summer internships with
            academic or industry research labs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Don't give up</b>: EngSci will have lots of tough moments. Lots
            of students spend so much time in their first two years debating
            whether or not to drop it. Instead, just focus on learning and
            getting things done. Keep pushing onwards!
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Meta learning</b>: Always be testing and evaluating new
            strategies to improve your performance e.g., how best do
            <i>you</i> learn?, focus strategies, study habits, exam taking
            skills, group collaboration skills.
